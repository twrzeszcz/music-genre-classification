# General Info
This is a music genre classification project with CNNs based on the mel spectrograms generated from audio files. Dataset was taken from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification). Preprocessing and training is done in the **music_classification_prep_train** notebook. Best model is deployed on [Streamlit](https://share.streamlit.io/twrzeszcz/music-generation-streamlit/main/app_streamlit_merged.py) where user can upload a *wav* audio file and predict the music genre. The *app* file can be found in [GitHub](https://github.com/twrzeszcz/music-generation-streamlit) since 2 modules are deployed in the single app.
